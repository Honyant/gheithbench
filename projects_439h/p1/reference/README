Due:
    test: 8/30/2024 @ 11:59pm
    code: 9/3/2024 @ 11:59pm

Objectives:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Become familiar with the project submission system
    - Become familiar with the kernel foundation code
    - Become familiar with the build system
    - Become familiar with C++
    - Think about concurrency, parallelism, race conditions,
      critical sections, and deadlocks

Assignment
~~~~~~~~~~

    - Finish the implementation 
    - Donate a test case
    - Answer the report questions in REPORT.txt

Rules for your test case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     - Model it after t0 and t1
     - You should add 2 files: <your csid>.cc and <your csid>.ok

Files you're allowed to change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

kernel/critical.h and kernel/critical.cc

   You can change the implementation but not the abstractions

   
For Makefile help:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make help

To run tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make test

To make the output less noisy:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s test

To remove all generated files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make clean

Sometimes (not very often) the working directory will get into an inconsistent
state. Running "make clean" would be the first step in dealing with that.

If "make clean" doesn't help:

    rm -rf kernel/build

Server view targets:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make get_results    # gets and displays your results
    make get_tests      # gets tests from the server
    make get_summary    # shows results per test

To run one test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s t0.test               # run the test once
    make -s t0.loop               # run the test 10 times
    LOOP_LIMIT=6 make -s t0.loop  # run the test 6 times
    make -s t0.fail               # run the test until it fails

To run by hand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ./run_qemu t0

To run with gdb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ./debug_qemu t0

       Then follow the instructions on the screen

Generated files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each test, a set of files will be generated:

    <test>.raw          the raw output from running QEMU
    <test>.time         how long it took to run the test
    <test>.failure      failure information in case of failure
    <test>.out          the lines that start with *** from the raw output
    <test>.diff         the difference between <test>.out and <test>.ok
    <test>.result       pass or fail

*** Begin!
*** Replacing cin with /data/fruit.txt:
***     Opened fruit.txt at fd 0
***     Reading (then closing) fruit.txt in separate processes:
***         Best fruit:
***         strawberries
***         blueberries
***         watermelon
***         apples
***     Wait with invalid pointer: -1
***     Last child exited with code 123
*** Opened concurrency.txt at fd 0
***     Seeking to 100: 100
***         Reading: -1
***     Seeking back to 0: 0
***     Closing it concurrently on several processes
***     MMapping it
***         Reading file: multithreading = pain
***     Reading after unmap: -1
*** Accessing nonexistent file: -1
*** Chdir-ing to nonexistent directory: -1
*** Execl-ing non-executable (/data/fruit.txt): -1
*** Execl-ing executable with bad memory address (/sbin/invalid): -1
*** Execl-ing with bad string address (/sbin/flags): -1
*** Pagefaulting at kernel address
***     Child exited with code -1
*** Pagefaulting at unmapped shared address
***     Child exited with code -1
*** Forking with overflow flag SET
***     In forked child: overflow flag is SET
***     Child exited with code 321
*** Forking with overflow flag UNSET
***     In forked child: overflow flag is UNSET
***     Child exited with code 321
*** Done with test case!

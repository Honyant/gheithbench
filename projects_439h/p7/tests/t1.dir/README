This is t0, ported to Rust. Feel free to use this as a starting point if you
want to write your own user-mode test case in Rust.

I tried getting this to compile on the lab machines, but was running into issues
so I ended up just compiling it locally. The issue is that although the lab
machines have cargo installed, they do not have rustup which is suggested to use
for Cargo.lock. Last year Gheith had a public rust compiler which I don't
remember having this issue, so hopefully we can get him to share that again.

I did this in Linux Mint 21 (Ubuntu 22.04). You may have to slightly adapt these
instructions depending on your OS.

1. Make sure you have Rust [cargo and rustup] installed.
     https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Run `make` in the test case sbin directory.
3. It may complain that Cargo.lock does not exist. If so, it will suggest adding
   rust-src component, go ahead and do so. This command is what I ran, but ymmv.
     rustup component add rust-src --toolchain stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
4. If you get other errors, try installing build-essential.
     sudo apt-get install build-essential
5. Otherwise, hopefully just running `make` will compile the test.

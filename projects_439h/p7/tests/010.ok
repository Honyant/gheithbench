*** Welcome to the bad executable test case!
*** This is a fairly straight forward test case.
*** All of them can be found to be invalid via the data you can see in elf load.
*** Every one of them should fail, and you should be able to continue executing this program.
*** after a failed execl (don't free all the memory before you know if the execl will succeed!)
*** Part 0: attempting to execl a nonexistent file
*** You can tell this is invalid because the file does not exist
*** did execl return -1? 1
*** Part 1: attempting to execl a tiny text file
*** You can tell this is invalid because it is too small to contian an elf header
*** did execl return -1? 1
*** Part 2: attempting to execl a BIG text file
*** You can tell this is invalid because the elf header does not contain the correct magic bytes (explained in elf.h)
*** did execl return -1? 1
*** Part 3: attempting to execl an invalid load address (trying to load the program into kernel memory)
*** You can tell this is invalid because it asks to be loaded at a kernel address
*** did execl return -1? 1
*** Great Job! You did it!

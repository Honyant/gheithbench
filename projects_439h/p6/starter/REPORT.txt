* How would you implement the "real" shared mappings?

      - multiple threads (processes) can map the same file in shared mode
      - changes made by any thread are immediately observed by all other
        sharing threads
      - changes made by any thread are immediately observed by threads
        doing read from the file
      - changes made by writing threads are immediately observed by
        threads that mapped the file in shared mode

* Can you guess why the assignment makes naive_unmap of shared mapping a
  noop?

* Why is it dangerous to call Debug::printf in the page fault handler?

* Read about the use of copy-on-write in virtual memory systems. Why is it a
  good idea? How would you implement it?

let me tell you about my favorite class, opearting systems with dr. ahmed gheith. Wow, what can I say. I'm just always entranced by the wonderful lectures and challenging projects. Every time I get an email with all the test cases I'm failing, I'm pushed to work harder and learn more about computer science. Oh, operating systems my operating systems, how I want you for all my life. I will forever be sad when I must leave operating systems, but forever grateful for the lovely concepts taught.

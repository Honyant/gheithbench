*** You made it to the start of the test case! Nice!
*** -------- Test 1 --------
*** We did a map: 0x80000000 -> hello.txt
*** Nice job!
*** -------- Test 2 --------
*** We did a shared map: 0xfec01000 -> hello.txt
*** Nice job!
*** Epic job!
*** -------- Test 3 --------
*** We unmapped hello.txt from 0x80000000
*** -------- Test 4 --------
*** We did another map: 0x80000000 -> thoughts.txt
*** What's the meaning of life? Who's to say...
*** -------- Test 5 --------
*** We did yet another map: 0x80000000 -> [blank space]
*** hello

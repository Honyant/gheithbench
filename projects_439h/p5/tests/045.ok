*** SYMLINK TESTS, TESTS MANY EDGE CASES
*** TEST 0: basic find, if you past t0, you should pass this
*** looking at /
***      is a directory
***      contains 7 entries
***      has 7 links
*** looking at /dir1
***      is a directory
***      contains 6 entries
***      has 3 links
*** looking at /dir2
***      is a directory
***      contains 3 entries
***      has 3 links
*** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** TEST 1: find + symlink, test both finding and resolving a relative symlink
*** looking at /dir1/relativeSym
***      is a symbolic link
***      link size is 15
***       => ../symlink_test
*** looking at symlink_test/
***      is a directory
***      contains 3 entries
***      has 2 links
*** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** TEST 2: test 1 for absolute symlinks
*** looking at /dir1/absoluteSym
***      is a symbolic link
***      link size is 13
***       => /symlink_test
*** looking at /symlink_test/
***      is a directory
***      contains 3 entries
***      has 2 links
*** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** TEST 3: resolving root symlinks
*** looking at /dir1/rootSym
***      is a symbolic link
***      link size is 1
***       => /
*** looking at /
***      is a directory
***      contains 7 entries
***      has 7 links
*** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** TEST 4: looped relative path symlink
*** looking at dir1/dir2
***      is a directory
***      contains 3 entries
***      has 3 links
*** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** TEST 5: assert symlink node is equal to actual node in a trie
*** passed test 5!
*** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

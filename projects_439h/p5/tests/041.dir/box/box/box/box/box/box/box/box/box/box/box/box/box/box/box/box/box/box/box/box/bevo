Do you know that thought experiment with the cat in the box with the poison? Theory requires the 
cat be both alive and dead until observed. Well, I actually performed the experiment. Dozens of 
times. The bad news is that reality doesn't exist. The good news is we have a new cat graveyard.
But we aren't talking about a cat in a box this time. We're talking about a bevo in a box. Is
the bevo in the box alive or dead? I'd say there isn't really a way to know if the bevo is dead or
alive but we're currently in the box aren't we? We could just check if the bevo is dead or alive
but where's the fun in that? There's no mystery if we check on bevo. I guess the only person who
will really know if bevo is dead or alive would be rh!!

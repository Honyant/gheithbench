* How many sectors are read while running t0?
31 sectors

* What techniques did you use to make your implementation run faster?
I cached the directory entries, superblock, BGDT, as well as the symlink names, I also cached blocks in a buffer to avoid reading the same block multiple times.

* Read about journaled file systems and log structured file systems and
  explain why we have them
Journaled file systems help prevent data loss in the event of a crash but writing to a journaled area, then update the main file system. Log structured file systems improve efficiency by writing everything sequentially (like a log), then having a garabage collector to clean up old data.

* Why do we need both hard links and symbolic links?
Hard links are useful because you can have multiple links point to data, and the data isn't deleted/unaccessible until you delete all hard links to the data. Symbolic links are useful because they can point to files that don't exist, or files on other file systems. Symbolic links also have the ability to point to invalid/nonexistent files/directories, which can be useful in some cases.

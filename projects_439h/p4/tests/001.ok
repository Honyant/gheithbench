*** Starting strong and weak pointer tests
*** Constructing TestObject 1
*** sp1 points to TestObject 1
*** Created wp1 from sp1
*** sp2 promotion succeeded, points to TestObject 1
*** sp1 reset to nullptr
*** sp3 promotion succeeded, points to TestObject 1
*** sp2 reset to nullptr
*** Destructing TestObject 1
*** sp2 and sp3 reset to nullptr
*** sp4 promotion failed as expected, object is deleted
*** Constructing TestObject 2
*** sp5 points to TestObject 2
*** sp6 copied from sp5, points to TestObject 2
*** sp5 reset to nullptr
*** sp6 still points to TestObject 2
*** sp7 promotion succeeded, points to TestObject 2
*** Destructing TestObject 2
*** sp6 and sp7 reset to nullptr
*** sp8 promotion failed as expected, object is deleted
*** Constructing Node 1
*** Constructing Node 2
*** node1 and node2 reset to nullptr
*** Finished strong and weak pointer tests

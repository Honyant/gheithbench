*** t1 - are you properly nullptr?
*** sp_null is a nullptr: true
*** a created with value 439
*** t2 - let's give you a value
*** value: 439
*** t3 - let's make a wkptr from the sptr
*** t4 - how about an upgrade!! wkptr -> sptr, now we have 2 sptrs!
*** sp2 is a nullptr: false
*** value: 439
*** t5 - let's give the second sptr a twin. now we have 3 sptrs!
*** value: 439
*** t6 - let's just make sure that your wkptr promotion works ok, and that it doesn't rely on sptrs that it shouldn't!
*** sp2 is a nullptr: true
*** sp4 is a nullptr: false
*** t7 - cool, now let's get rid of all of the other sptrs and try to promote a wkptr...what is the expected outcome?
*** trying to promote wp1 to sp5...
*** sp5 is a nullptr: false
*** t8 - final one! let's see if your reference counting works with circular references
*** a created with value 1
*** a created with value 2

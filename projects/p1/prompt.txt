# CS429H Project 1

## Task
Port the provided C++ interpreter for a simple language (FUN) to C. The C++ reference implementation is provided — you must rewrite it in C while preserving identical behavior.

## Assignment Specification
Objectives:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Become familiar with the assignment submission environment
    - Become familiar with build tools
    - Start reading C++ programs
    - Start writing C programs

Assignment:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Port an interpreter for a simple language from C++ to C

The language (it's a stretch to call it that):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The language has no formal definition. It is defined by the given interpreter

Here is a quick overview:

   - all values are encoded as 64 bit unsigned binary numbers
   - 2 statements:

       print <expression>      // prints the value of the expression
                               // as a 64 bit unsigned quantity

       <identifier> = <expression> // assign the value of the expression
                                   // to the identifier

    - operators are +, -, *, /, %. Same precedence, associativity, and
      semantics as C

    - '(' and ')' are used to change precedence

    - identifiers must start with an alphabetic character and contain
      alphanumeric characters

Important files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    *.c     C files, feel free to add them, remove them, edit them, etc.
    *.cxx   C++ files, your job is to get rid of all of them
    *.h     header files, feel free to add them, remove them, edit them, etc.


Generated files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    for each test:

        <test>.out    output from running the test
        <test>.diff   differences between the actual and expected output
        <test>.result pass/fail

To run tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make test

To make the output less noisy:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s test

To run one test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s t0.test

To run by hand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ./p1 < t0.fun


## Workspace Files
The following files are in your workspace:
```
Makefile
README
REPORT.txt
main.cxx
slice.cxx
slice.h
```

There are 59 tests available. Tests are located in the `tests/` directory (or flat in the workspace for P5).

## Instructions
1. Read and understand all provided source files in your workspace.
2. Implement the required functionality by modifying the source files.
3. To compile and test, use the `./exec` wrapper which runs commands in a Linux
   environment with all necessary tools:
   - `./exec 'make'` — compile
   - `./exec 'make -s test'` — run all tests
4. You can edit files directly — they are shared with the build environment.
5. Focus on correctness first, then optimization.

## Constraints
- Do NOT modify the Makefile, README, or any test files (.ok files).
- Do NOT modify the REPORT.txt file.
- You may create new source files if needed, but prefer modifying existing ones.
- The code must compile without warnings (`-Wall -Werror` is enabled).

# CS429H Project 5

## Task
Implement malloc() and free() in C. Your allocator must manage a heap using sbrk(), handle allocations of varying sizes, and correctly free memory for reuse.

## Assignment Specification
Objective:
~~~~~~~~~~

- Become better at working with memory and pointers in C

Assignment:
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Implement your own malloc/free

Rules:
~~~~~~

- heap/heap.h declares 4 important variables:

   - heap_size, contains the total heap size in bytes, defined by the test
   - the_heap, the memory for the heap, defined by the test
   - mCount, number of times malloc is called, defined and updated by heap.c
   - fCount, number of times free is called, defined and updated by heap.c

- Your implementation should only use the memory defined by "the_heap" to
  implement the heap.

## Workspace Files
The following files are in your workspace:
```
heap/heap.c
heap/heap.h
heap/panic.c
heap/panic.h
Makefile
README
```

There are 59 tests available. Tests are located in the `tests/` directory (or flat in the workspace for P5).

## Instructions
1. Read and understand all provided source files in your workspace.
2. Implement the required functionality by modifying the source files.
3. To compile and test, use the `./exec` wrapper which runs commands in a Linux
   environment with all necessary tools:
   - `./exec 'make'` — compile
   - `./exec 'make -s test'` — run all tests
4. You can edit files directly — they are shared with the build environment.
5. Focus on correctness first, then optimization.

## Constraints
- Do NOT modify the Makefile, README, or any test files (.ok files).
- Do NOT modify the REPORT.txt file.
- You may create new source files if needed, but prefer modifying existing ones.
- The code must compile without warnings (`-Wall -Werror` is enabled).

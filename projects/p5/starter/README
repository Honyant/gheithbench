Objective:
~~~~~~~~~~

- Become better at working with memory and pointers in C

Assignment:
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Implement your own malloc/free

Rules:
~~~~~~

- heap/heap.h declares 4 important variables:

   - heap_size, contains the total heap size in bytes, defined by the test
   - the_heap, the memory for the heap, defined by the test
   - mCount, number of times malloc is called, defined and updated by heap.c
   - fCount, number of times free is called, defined and updated by heap.c

- Your implementation should only use the memory defined by "the_heap" to
  implement the heap.

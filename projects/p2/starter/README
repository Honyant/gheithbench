Objectives:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Improve your C skills
    - Think about performance

Assignment:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Add more features to the language

The language (it's a stretch to call it that):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The language has no formal definition. It is defined by the given interpreter

Here is a quick overview:

   - all values are encoded as 64 bit unsigned binary numbers
   - 2 statements:

       print <expression>      // prints the value of the expression
                               // as a 64 bit unsigned quantity

       <identifier> = <expression> // assign the value of the expression
                                   // to the identifier

    - operators are +, -, *, /, %. Same precedence, associativity, and
      semantics as C

    - '(' and ')' are used to change precedence

    - identifiers must start with an alphabetic character and contain
      alphanumeric characters


Extra features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- operators (<=, <, >=, ">", "==", "!=", "&&", "||", ",", "&") with the
  same semantics, precedence, and associativity) as their C counterparts

- "if" statement (with optional "else"):

    if <expression> <statement> [else <statement>]

- "while" statement:

    while <expression> statement

- "fun" expression:

    fun <statement>

    Defines a function that runs the given statement when called.
    All functions take exactly one uint64_t argument and return
    one uint64_t value.

    The <statement> can access the passed argument as the local
    variable named "it"

    "fun" doesn't run the statement; it returns an opaque uint64_t
    that identifies the function.

- function call expression:

    <identifier>(<expression>)

    Calls the given function, passing it the result of evaluating
    <expression>. The value of the whole expression is the value
    returned by the function; 0 if there is no return

- "return" statement:

    return <expression>

    Can only be used inside a function. Returns from the function with
    the value of the given expression

See the provided test cases for examples.

Important files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    *.c     C files, feel free to add them, remove them, edit them, etc.
    *.h     header files, feel free to add them, remove them, edit them, etc.
    
Generated files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    for each test:

        <test>.out    output from running the test
        <test>.diff   differences between the actual and expected output
        <test>.result pass/fail

To run tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make test

To make the output less noisy:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s test

To run one test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s t0.test

To run by hand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ./build/main t0.fun
